Safe need to be update at every call of the function

The get next line function aim to read bytes

line is ended by a /n or /0 if it's the end of the file.
The function has to keep in memory everything it has already

For example if in what it has readed (BUFFER_size) there is a \n.
It has to be abble to return the bytes readed to \n. But also to keep in memory,
the bytes readed between /n and buffer_size to store every extra bytes read and
